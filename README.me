Simple program to count occurances of each word from string.
Converts the string into an array, split by whitespace between each word.
Checks if each word includes the word in the dictionary, and if so adds 1 to the value for the word, otherwise assigns the value 1 to the key.
Returns a new hash contains each word as a key, with the number of occurances as the value.
